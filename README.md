### Objective

The primary objective of this project was to familiarize students with forest inventory calculation methods (visual method) and gain experience using the **Forest Data Bank**. The project involved dividing a selected area into forest sections, learning data extraction from forest resource tables, and understanding forest management practices across different ownership forms.

### Forest Division and Subdivision

Initially, the selected area was divided into sections, and Section 24 was further subdivided based on species composition and percentage share (refer to Figure 1).

### Forest Complex Data

Detailed analysis was conducted on the forest's structure and composition in Kartuzy Forest District, including area classifications and species types.

### Traditional Forest Inventory System

This part covers the classical approach to forest inventory, including visual assessment techniques and metrics used for forest management.

### Results

The analysis includes:
- Average tree height and diameter at breast height (DBH).
- Site productivity indices for each tree species.
- Stand density and annual growth increments.

### Stand Parameters

The project calculated key parameters such as the **stand quality index** and **timber volume** for different species, focusing on pine in two categories.

### Site Type and Indicators

Using site classification diagrams, the primary forest type in this region was identified as **fresh sites**.

### Timber Volume and Growth Rates

Key metrics include:
- **Timber volume (Vt)** and **current annual increment (PBRt)** for both mature and young timber.
- **Actual stand volume (Vrz)** and **current annual increment (PBRrz)** were also calculated to determine forest productivity.

### Species Distribution for Pomeranian Voivodeship

The project examined forest area changes across species within the Pomeranian Voivodeship from **2012 to 2022**. Key findings are illustrated in diagrams showing:
- Changes in pine, spruce, and fir populations.
- Overall increase in forest cover by approximately 100,000 trees over the 10-year period, despite a decrease in spruce population.

### Visualization

Graphs show the area and changes for pine, spruce, and fir within the Pomeranian Voivodeship, providing a clear visual overview of the forest dynamics from 2012 to 2022.
